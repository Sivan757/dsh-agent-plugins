# Automation Recommender

Analyze codebase patterns to recommend tailored DeepSeek Harness automations across all extensibility options.

**This skill is read-only.** It analyzes the codebase and outputs recommendations. It does NOT create or modify any files. Users implement the recommendations themselves or ask the agent separately to help build them.

## Output Guidelines

- **Recommend 1-2 of each type**: Don't overwhelm - surface the top 1-2 most valuable automations per category
- **If user asks for a specific type**: Focus only on that type and provide more options (3-5 recommendations)
- **Go beyond the reference lists**: The reference files contain common patterns, but use web search to find recommendations specific to the codebase's tools, frameworks, and libraries
- **Tell users they can ask for more**: End by noting they can request more recommendations for any specific category

## Automation Types Overview

| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Hooks** | Automatic actions on tool events (format on save, lint, block edits) |
| **Subagents** | Specialized reviewers/analyzers that run in parallel |
| **Skills** | Packaged expertise, workflows, and repeatable tasks (invoked by the agent or user via `/skill-name`) |
| **Plugins** | Collections of skills that can be installed |
| **MCP Servers** | External tool integrations (databases, APIs, browsers, docs) |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis

Gather project context:

```bash
# Detect project type and tools
ls -la package.json pyproject.toml Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml 2>/dev/null
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | head -50

# Check dependencies for MCP server recommendations
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -E '"(react|vue|angular|next|express|fastapi|django|prisma|supabase|convex|stripe)"'

# Check for existing DeepSeek Harness config
ls -la .agents/ AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null

# Analyze project structure
ls -la src/ app/ lib/ tests/ components/ pages/ api/ 2>/dev/null
```

**Key Indicators to Capture:**

| Category | What to Look For | Informs Recommendations For |
|----------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Language/Framework | package.json, pyproject.toml, import patterns | Hooks, MCP servers |
| Frontend stack | React, Vue, Angular, Next.js | Playwright MCP, frontend skills |
| Backend stack | Express, FastAPI, Django | API documentation tools |
| Database | Prisma, Supabase, Convex, raw SQL | Database / backend MCP servers |
| External APIs | Stripe, OpenAI, AWS SDKs | context7 MCP for docs |
| Testing | Jest, pytest, Playwright configs | Testing hooks, subagents |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions, CircleCI | GitHub MCP server |
| Issue tracking | Linear, Jira references | Issue tracker MCP |
| Docs patterns | OpenAPI, JSDoc, docstrings | Documentation skills |

### Phase 2: Generate Recommendations

Based on analysis, generate recommendations across all categories:

#### A. MCP Server Recommendations

See [references/mcp-servers.md](references/mcp-servers.md) for detailed patterns.

| Codebase Signal | Recommended MCP Server |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Uses popular libraries (React, Express, etc.) | **context7** - Live documentation lookup |
| Frontend with UI testing needs | **Playwright** - Browser automation/testing |
| Uses Supabase | **Supabase MCP** - Direct database operations |
| Uses Convex | **Convex MCP** - Live deployment introspection, run queries/mutations, manage env vars and logs |
| PostgreSQL/MySQL database | **Database MCP** - Query and schema tools |
| GitHub repository | **GitHub MCP** - Issues, PRs, actions |
| Uses Linear for issues | **Linear MCP** - Issue management |
| AWS infrastructure | **AWS MCP** - Cloud resource management |
| Slack workspace | **Slack MCP** - Team notifications |
| Memory/context persistence | **Memory MCP** - Cross-session memory |
| Sentry error tracking | **Sentry MCP** - Error investigation |
| Docker containers | **Docker MCP** - Container management |

#### B. Skills Recommendations

See [references/skills-reference.md](references/skills-reference.md) for details.

Create skills in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and commands in `.agents/commands/<name>.md`; the project contributes both only while the market plugin's project-layout scan is on. Some are also available via plugins:

| Codebase Signal | Skill | Plugin |
|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Building plugins | skill-development | plugin-dev |
| Git commits | commit | commit-commands |
| React/Vue/Angular | frontend-design | frontend-design |
| Automation rules | writing-rules | hookify |
| Feature planning | feature-dev | feature-dev |

**Custom skills to create** (with templates, scripts, examples):

| Codebase Signal | Skill to Create | Invocation |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| API routes | **api-doc** (with OpenAPI template) | Both |
| Database project | **create-migration** (with validation script) | User-only |
| Test suite | **gen-test** (with example tests) | User-only |
| Component library | **new-component** (with templates) | User-only |
| PR workflow | **pr-check** (with checklist) | User-only |
| Releases | **release-notes** (with git context) | User-only |
| Code style | **project-conventions** | Model-only |
| Onboarding | **setup-dev** (with prereq script) | User-only |

#### C. Hooks Recommendations

See [references/hooks-patterns.md](references/hooks-patterns.md) for configurations.

| Codebase Signal | Recommended Hook |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Prettier configured | PostToolUse: auto-format on edit |
| ESLint/Ruff configured | PostToolUse: auto-lint on edit |
| TypeScript project | PostToolUse: type-check on edit |
| Tests directory exists | PostToolUse: run related tests |
| `.env` files present | PreToolUse: block `.env` edits |
| Lock files present | PreToolUse: block lock file edits |
| Security-sensitive code | PreToolUse: require confirmation |

#### D. Subagent Recommendations

See [references/subagent-templates.md](references/subagent-templates.md) for templates. Subagents are agent role cards under the plugin's `com.deepseek.harness/agents/` or the project's `.agents/agents/`, delegated to with `subagent_run`.

| Codebase Signal | Recommended Subagent |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Large codebase (>500 files) | **code-reviewer** - Parallel code review |
| Auth/payments code | **security-reviewer** - Security audits |
| API project | **api-documenter** - OpenAPI generation |
| Performance critical | **performance-analyzer** - Bottleneck detection |
| Frontend heavy | **ui-reviewer** - Accessibility review |
| Needs more tests | **test-writer** - Test generation |

#### E. Plugin Recommendations

See [references/plugins-reference.md](references/plugins-reference.md) for available plugins.

| Codebase Signal | Recommended Plugin |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| General productivity | **agent-skills** - Core skills bundle |
| Document workflows | Install docx, xlsx, pdf skills |
| Frontend development | **frontend-design** plugin |
| Building AI tools | **mcp-builder** for MCP development |

### Phase 3: Output Recommendations Report

Format recommendations clearly. **Only include 1-2 recommendations per category** - the most valuable ones for this specific codebase. Skip categories that aren't relevant.

## Decision Framework

### When to Recommend MCP Servers
- External service integration needed (databases, APIs)
- Documentation lookup for libraries/SDKs
- Browser automation or testing
- Team tool integration (GitHub, Linear, Slack)
- Cloud infrastructure management

### When to Recommend Skills

- Document generation (docx, xlsx, pptx, pdf — also in plugins)
- Frequently repeated prompts or workflows
- Project-specific tasks with arguments
- Applying templates or scripts to tasks (skills can bundle supporting files)
- Quick actions invoked with `/skill-name`
- Workflows whose heavy work should stay out of the main context — the skill body delegates to an agent role card with `subagent_run`

**Invocation control:**
- `disable-model-invocation: true` — User-only (for side effects: deploy, commit, send)
- `user-invocable: false` — Model-only (for background knowledge)
- Default (omit both) — Both can invoke

### When to Recommend Hooks
- Repetitive post-edit actions (formatting, linting)
- Protection rules (block sensitive file edits)
- Validation checks (tests, type checks)

### When to Recommend Subagents
- Specialized expertise needed (security, performance)
- Parallel review workflows
- Background quality checks

### When to Recommend Plugins
- Need multiple related skills
- Want pre-packaged automation bundles
- Team-wide standardization

## Configuration Tips

### MCP Server Setup

MCP servers are declared in a plugin's `mcp.json` or the project's `.agents/mcp.json`.

**Team sharing**: Check `.agents/mcp.json` into repo so entire team gets same MCP servers

**Debugging**: The market page's MCP services tab reports each service's status and failures

**Prerequisites to recommend:**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) - enables native GitHub operations
- Puppeteer/Playwright CLI - for browser MCP servers

### Headless Mode (for CI/Automation)

Recommend the headless profile for automated pipelines:

```bash
# Pre-commit hook example
dsh --profile headless "fix lint errors in src/"

# CI pipeline piping the final message into the next command
dsh --profile headless "<prompt>" | your_command
```

### Permissions for Hooks

Hook commands run under the session's sandbox and approval policy. Set the default for new sessions in `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
permission:
  defaultPreset: workspace-write
```

Switch the policy for the current session with the `/permission` command.
